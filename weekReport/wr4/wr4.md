## Basic terminology 
* **File system:** The way files are store and managed.  
* **Current directory:** The directory you are presently at. 
* **parent directory:** A particular directory that contains folders or subdirectories.
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** Your home directory is associated with the users account, while the home directory is associated with the root user which is the administrator of your system. 
* **pathname:** The location of the file in the filesystem. 
* **relative path:** The location of a file starting from the current working directory that is located inside the current working directory. 
* **absolute path:** The location of a file starting at the root of the file system.
